    <h1>Animal Trading Cards Collection</h1>
    <h2>Welcome Everyone!</h2>
    <p>I have created a variety of animal trading cards. I did my first Front End course proejct, which was creating an animal trading card.
    I enjoyed creating my trading card. Once I finished and submitted my project, I showed my children and they loved it. They asked for me
    to create trading cards for all of their favorite animals. So I have begun this task.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p2> I want to continue building on this collection, and eventually have a collection of all the animals we see at zoos across the country.
      I think this would be extremely fun for my children and give me the extra practice with HTML and CSS.</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p3> As I embark on this journey to becoming a software engineer, I am excited that I have found a way to include my children in
      something that I am passionate about. </p3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p4>Below you will find links to the animal trading cards that I have added to the collection thus far. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. &#128516;</p4>
