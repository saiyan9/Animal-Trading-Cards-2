      <p>American Alligators live in the wild in southeastern United States. They are extremely common in Florida and Louisiana. They are excellent swimmers, but clumsy when on land. They can be found in marshes, swamps, bayous, rivers, lakes and ponds. The main threat to American Alligators is caused by human development of the wetlands.</p>
